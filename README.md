# 🛠️ Custom ESP32-S3 Development Board | Designed in Altium
This repository contains the design files for a custom ESP32-S3-based development board, created entirely in Altium Designer. This project was a focused exercise in advanced PCB design, aiming to reinforce practical skills in schematic capture, multilayer layout, and design-for-manufacturing principles.

🔧 Key Features

1.ESP32-S3 module (Wi-Fi + BLE support)

2.Dual USB Type-C connectors

3.FTDI USB-to-Serial bridge for programming and debugging

4.WS2812B RGB LED for visual status indication

5.4-layer PCB stackup for optimized routing and signal integrity

6.GPIO headers for expandability and prototyping

📘 Learning Outcomes

1.Implementation of USB differential pair routing and impedance control

2.4-layer stackup planning with solid ground/power plane strategy

3.Application of DFM (Design for Manufacturing) constraints

4.Creation of custom component footprints based on datasheets

5.Best practices for component placement, routing, and via management
